# Recordbox 

# ðŸ’½ðŸŽ›ðŸ’½

## Whats the idea?

Record box is a place to store your music and keep track of your records. You can add your records to your box, and keep track of them. 

## Technology used

I have build this app using Ruby on Rails as a simple CRUD app.

Some of the features include:
- PG search
- Devise
- API with OpenURI and the discogs API
- Testing 
  - System Tests using Capybara
  - Unit Tests using rspec

## Next Steps

I have seeded the database with information from the Discogs API. This isn't the most practical approach. I plan to build the app using a React Front End and then storing the data in the backend.  Users will be able to create their collections from the entire Discogs database and import their collection.

If all goes well with that approach I plan to build a DJ tool that helps DJs to pack their bags for tours. ðŸ›«
